put it in matlab, and use it.  

```matlab
============= how to use LDA =====================  
 Input && Target is Matrix we know it's target.  
   W = LDA( Input, Target);  
   Data = Input*W;
 Data is dimension-reduced by LDA.
==================================================  
```
```matlab  
============= how to use KNN =====================  
 Data is the test Matrix. We get it target by knn.  
   
 Input && Target is Matrix we know it's target.  
 k is the most nearst k neighbour.  
 
 Result = KNN( Data, Input, Target, k);  
==================================================
